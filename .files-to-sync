# This file contains all the items you wish to sync into the git repository:
#  * folders [paths ending with '/']
#  * files [other paths not ending with '/']
#
# Every line starting with '#' (comment) is ignored. Example:
# /etc/default/     -- folder to be backed up [recursively by default]
# /etc/os-release   -- single file to be backed up
