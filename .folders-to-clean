# vim: filetype=bash

# List of backed up folders to be removed just before the new backup happens...
# This way we make sure the paths removed from .files-to-sync file will be truly
# removed...
#
# Every line starting with '#' (comment) is ignored. Example:
# boot/
# etc/
# opt/
# root/
# usr/
# var/
